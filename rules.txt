welcome to the killer rules!
1: swearing in a channel or private message is prohibited.
2: someone can be banned without warning you, you have to read the rules! you already accept the rules before entering the game!
3: asking for rank without reason, you will be punished without warning!
4: you know a bug, but if you don't use it to people who are developer and admins, you will be punished if you get caught if the cheat is small!
5: do not disturb the developer without stopping!
6: More than 1 accounts are not allowed!
7: Insulting by voice chat is prohibited!

This is our rules written here for now ...
but the possibility of expression is high, I think you should use the / rules command every day while you are in the game!
