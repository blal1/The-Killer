<h3>availability</h3>
The killer for most its lifetime, was available as free software. However, there has been an extreme amount of abuse the server was receiving, therefore the game is now $10. If you have a paid account, you should have gotten an email with your new activation key. If you still do not have an email, feel free to contact me with the contact information below.
